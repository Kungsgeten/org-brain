;;; Commentary:

;; org-brain implements a variant of concept mapping with org-mode, it is
;; inspired by The Brain software (http://thebrain.com). An org-brain is a
;; network of org-mode entries, where each entry is a file or a headline, and
;; you can get a visual overview of the relationships between the entries:
;; parents, children, siblings and friends. This visual overview can also be
;; used to browse your entries. You can think of entries as nodes in a mind map,
;; or pages in a wiki.

;; All org files put into your `org-brain-path' directory will be considered
;; entries in your org-brain. Headlines with an ID property in your entry file(s)
;; are also considered as entries.

;; Use `org-brain-visualize' to see the relationships between entries, quickly
;; add parents/children/friends/pins to an entry, and open them for editing.
